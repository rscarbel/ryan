          <p>
            I&#39;m a fullstack software engineer. I started my coding journey
            in 2008 by building desktop apps in visual basic. I took a hiatus
            from coding for a while and then picked it up again in 2019 by
            learning Python.
          </p>

          <p>
            In early 2020 I shifted towards web development. I worked as a
            software engineer for a startup starting at the end of 2020 and into
            2021. I attended and graduated from a coding bootcamp, General
            Assembly to supplement my knowledge &amp; skills. Today, I work as a
            Full Stack Software Engineer for HireArt.
          </p>

          <p>
            My strongest assets for a development team are my ability to work
            well with people of any personality type, do
            test-driven-development, and design system architecture.
